# TODO

- Setup default workspaces for apps:
    - 1: firefox
    - 2: editor/tmux (foot + tmux sessionizer)
    - 3: datagrip
    - 4: ticktick
    - 5: terminal
    - 10: teams
- Make caps lock do escape on press and control on hold
- Change tmux prefix to ctrl-a
- Change background to solid color #749F8D
- Change cursor to a normal cursor instead of hyprland cursor
- Setup Context7 MCP with opencode.ai configuration
- Make display switchting work perfectly:
    - Connecting a new display should always work and extend the current display (so a display without kanshi config) and it should be scaled reasonably. Sometimes large presenting screens are connected.
    - Disconnecting a display often leaves the internal display unusable, requiring a forced restart. This should never be the case.
- Organise project:
    - remove duplicate packages.
    - instead of one huge packages file, add packages in the module file where they're relevant.


## Neovim
- setup working tmux config with kinesis (IGNORED)
- change quickfix icon to more subtle icon
- setup easy keybinds for buffer diagnostics with jumps and quickfix actions
- add good keybinds for undotree
- setup which-key for ALL existing keybinds and plugins, so you have one well-working keybind setup
